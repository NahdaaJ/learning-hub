## What is OOP?
- A computer programming model that organises software design around data (objects).
- Focuses on the objects devs want to manipulate as opposed to the logic to manipulate them.
- Has 4 pillar concepts: **encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism**.

Good For - large, complex, actively maintained, actively updated projects.

`Object` - Data type, instance of a class with stored data.
`Class` - Blueprint of data type.
`Methods` - Functions an object can perform.
`Attributes` - Represent the 'state' of an object, i.e. data stored in the object.

## Encapsulation
_How does this thing do it and who's allowed to touch/see it's insides?_

- All important info is contained winside an object.
- Objects are self-contained - easy to trouble shoot.

Example: 
TV Remote - you don't see the wires, motherboard or hardware. 

## Abstraction
_What can this thing do?_

- Objects only reveal relevant internal info.
- Hides unnecessary details from user.

Example:
TV Remote - you can use the buttons (vol. up, vol. down) but you don't know the implementations behind the button.
